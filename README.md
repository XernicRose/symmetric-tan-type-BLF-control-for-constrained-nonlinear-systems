# symmetric-tan-type-BLF-control-for-constrained-nonlinear-systems
The basically reproduction of the article "Tangent Barrier Lyapunov Functions for the Control of Output-Constrained Nonlinear Systems".But only this code
achieves the symmetric part of article.

Adding a sliding mode differentiator to estimate the x1's differentiation as follow:

And also the origial differentiator in the article is as follow:

Wish it take effort for you.
